1. Introduce in the configuration file the possibility to define a custom name for the attributes that mark the changes in the output stream, because the current default name, "mod", may already by used in the files that are being compared.
 If this happens now, then two "mod" attributes may appear in the same tag which will render the content of the output as invalid XML.

2. Implement XML namespaces processing.

3. Implement a memory/load calculator to determine the maximum input size that can be processed on the user's machine without JMV crashing or throwing a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError.

4. Implement a performance calculator to determine how much slower the processing gets with an increase in input size on the same machine/configuration.

5. Implement the library to use multiple threads and then do a scalability test to determine if an increase in [threading] resources will produce an increase in performance.
