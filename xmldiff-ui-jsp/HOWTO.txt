1. To build the project with Maven create a Maven Run/Debug configuration and give it the following command line arguments: clean install.


2. To run/debug/test the project:
- create a Maven Run/Debug configuration and give it the following command line arguments: jetty:run
- then run this configuration in release/debug mode
For this to work the following plugin was added in the pom.xml <build>:

        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.mortbay.jetty</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-jetty-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>6.1.26</version>
            <configuration>
                <connectors>
                    <connector implementation="org.mortbay.jetty.nio.SelectChannelConnector">
                        <port>8000</port>                <!-- Use another appropriate port number if this is already used-->
                    </connector>
                </connectors>
                <scanIntervalSeconds>10</scanIntervalSeconds>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>

IMPORTANT: I noticed that after I linked this project to its github repository, jetty stopped working(it was not stopping at break points anymore), so I disconnected it from the repository so I can use it for testing!

- put some breakpoints if in debug mode
- then call the app in your browser at this address http://localhost:8000/xmldiff-ui-jsp/.


With Tomcat would be: http://localhost:8080/xmldiff-ui-jsp-1.0/
but first make sure you started it (/opt/apache-tomcat-7.0.32/bin/startup.sh) and deployed the .war to its webapps folder (it will unpack it automatically).
