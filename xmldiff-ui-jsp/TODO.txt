2. Add a reset button for the field that holds the path to the configuration file
3. Add Javascript validation to keep the client-server communication to a minimum
4. Provide a button to download the output data
5. Provide a better navigation menu than opening results in new browser tabs
6. Build a version with JSF (RichFace/PrimeFaces)
7. Build a version that contains inside it jetty so it can run without an external application server
8. Is best to disable the scriplets/Java code from inside the .jsp files inside web.xml with:

    <jsp-config>
        <jsp-property-group>
            <url-pattern>*.jsp</url-pattern>
            <scripting-invalid>true</scripting-invalid>
        </jsp-property-group>
    </jsp-config>

And instead use only JSP tags.

9. Should be safe to be ran by multiple users/threads at the same time
10. Build a standalone version with an embedded Jetty web server
